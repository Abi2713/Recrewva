## Project Overview

Recrewva is an innovative recruitment platform designed to streamline the hiring process, integrating advanced features with a modern tech stack. This project primarily utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and includes various modules like job creation, custom reports, and an application form.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories, each containing specific implementations that integrate into the main Recrewva platform:

- **[Recrewva/](Recrewva/)** - Main directory for the recruitment platform, housing the core logic and entry point for the application.
- **[applicationform/](applicationform/)** - Handles candidate application forms, submission, and validation processes.
- **[custom-reports-app/](custom-reports-app/)** - Manages custom reporting features, providing insights and analytics for recruitment data.
- **[jobcreation/](jobcreation/)** - Facilitates the creation, editing, and management of job postings within the platform.

Each of these modules integrates seamlessly into the main Recrewva application, contributing to a cohesive and efficient recruitment platform.

## Technologies Used

The project is built on the MERN stack, which includes:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store all application data, including user information, job postings, and reports.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for Node.js, used to handle API requests, routing, and server-side logic.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface, including forms, dashboards, and job management screens.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side of the application, managing the backend services and database interactions.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation and setup, you can begin using Recrewva to manage recruitment processes efficiently. Below are the key features and how to use them:

### 1. **Job Creation and Management**
   - **Create a New Job Posting**: Navigate to the "Job Creation" section on the platform. Fill in the necessary details such as Job Title, Department, Description, and Requirements. You can save the job as a draft or publish it immediately.
   - **Edit or Delete Draft Jobs**: Access the "Draft Jobs" section to view, edit, or delete any job postings saved as drafts.
   - **Manage Published Jobs**: Go to the "Published Jobs" section to view all active job postings. You can edit, unpublish, or view detailed statistics for each job.

### 2. **Candidate Application Forms**
   - **View and Manage Applications**: Under the "Applications" section, you can see all submitted candidate applications. Each application can be reviewed in detail, including the candidate's resume and cover letter.
   - **Form Customization**: Customize the application form fields to collect the specific information you need from candidates. This can include text inputs, file uploads, or multiple-choice questions.

### 3. **Custom Reporting**
   - **Generate Custom Reports**: Use the "Custom Reports" feature to generate reports based on various recruitment metrics such as application count, job posting performance, or candidate demographics.
   - **Data Export**: Export the generated reports as CSV files for further analysis or for sharing with other stakeholders.

### 4. **User Authentication**
   - **Registration and Login**: Users can register for an account and log in to access the platformâ€™s features. Ensure that user roles are properly assigned to limit access to sensitive data.
   - **Password Recovery**: If a user forgets their password, they can use the "Forgot Password" feature to reset it. This process involves receiving a recovery email with a link to set a new password.

### 5. **Dashboard Overview**
   - **View Key Metrics**: Upon logging in, users are greeted with a dashboard that provides an overview of key recruitment metrics such as total job postings, active applications, and recent activity.
   - **Quick Navigation**: The dashboard offers quick links to important sections like Job Creation, Applications, and Reports.

### 6. **Notifications**
   - **Receive Notifications**: Users will receive notifications for important events such as new applications submitted, job postings nearing expiration, or reports generated. These notifications can be viewed in the notification panel on the dashboard.

## Future Integration of Generative AI

Generative AI (Gen AI) represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, enabling systems to create new content, insights, and personalized experiences based on existing data. In Phase 2 of the Recrewva platform, we plan to integrate Gen AI capabilities to enhance the recruitment process by automating resume screening, generating insightful candidate reports, and personalizing job recommendations. This will provide a smarter, more efficient hiring experience.
